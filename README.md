In this project, a Web application is created to display random quotes by famous people each time the button "Next Quote" is clicked. All quotes are selected carefully according to some criteria: they are all tasteful, positive and uncontroversial quotes.

The work of this project includes:
- Build the array of quote objects to store the quotes.
- Use Javascript to write my own function to select random quotes from the array and print them to the screen. 

This project is a simple interactive portfolio piece to show that I have understanding of Javascript. To do this project, I need knowledge about:
- Basic Javascript syntax
- Variables, loops and conditional statements.
